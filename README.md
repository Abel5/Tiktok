**Background on the TikTok Scenario**

At TikTok, our mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy. Our employees lead with curiosity and move at the speed of culture. Combined with our company's flat structure, you'll be given dynamic opportunities to make a real impact on a rapidly expanding company, and grow your career.

TikTok users have the ability to submit reports that identify videos and comments that contain user claims. These reports identify content that needs to be reviewed by moderators. The process generates a large number of user reports that are challenging to consider in a timely manner. 

TikTok is working on the development of a predictive model that can determine whether a video contains a claim or offers an opinion. With a successful prediction model, TikTok can reduce the backlog of user reports and prioritize them more efficiently.

**Project Background**

TikTok’s data team is near the end of the claims classification project. The following tasks are needed to complete the project:

1. Model building
2. Model evaluation
3. Summarize findings for cross-departmental stakeholders within TikTok

**Your Assignment**

You will create the final machine learning model for the claims classification data. You will be responsible for leading these final tasks, which include feature engineering, model development, and evaluation. 

**Team Members at TikTok**

**Data Team Roles**

- Willow Jaffey - Data Science Lead
- Rosie Mae Bradshaw - Data Science Manager
- Orion Rainier - Data Scientist

The members of the data team at TikTok are well versed in data analysis and data science. Messages to these more technical coworkers should be concise and specific.

**Cross-functional Team Members**

- Mary Joanna Rodgers - Project Management Officer
- Margery Adebowale - Finance Lead, Americas
- Maika Abadi - Operations Lead

Your TikTok team includes several managers, who oversee operations. It is important to adjust your general correspondence appropriately to their roles, given that their responsibilities are less technical in nature.

**Specific Project Deliverables**

With this end-of-course project, you will gain valuable practice and apply your new skills as you complete the following:

1. Course 6 PACE Strategy Document to consider questions, details, and action items for each stage of the project scenario
2. Answer the questions in the Jupyter notebook project file
3. Build a machine learning model
4. Evaluate the model
5. Interpret the results
6. Create an executive summary to share your results with cross-departmental stakeholders within TikTok

**Good luck with this project! Your team members at TikTok are looking forward to seeing how you communicate your creative work and approach problem-solving!**

**Key Takeaways**

The Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate end-of-course project is designed for you to practice and apply course skills in a fictional workplace scenario. By completing each course’s end-of-course project, you will have work examples that will enhance your portfolio and showcase your skills for future employers.
